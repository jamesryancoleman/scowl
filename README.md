# scowl
Managing smart-grid resources with a distributed SCADA implemented with OWL

# System Overview

Scowl is built out of three (3) core entities. In the real world, each entity would reside on a discrete host connected over the Internet. For the purposes of evaluation, each `Tracker` has its own host, which it shares with the `Peers` and `SuperPeers` it is responsible for.

## Tracker
Equivalent to a regional electric grid controller. `Tracker`s hold region state including total generation and demand. A `Tracker` computes *ephemeral distribution trees* for each `generator`, fitting as many `consumer`s within its tree as is safe to do.

## Peer
Equivalent to a Distributed Energy Resource (DER). May be a `generator` or `consumer`.

## SuperPeer
A special peer that can `transition()` between being a `Consumer` and `Generator` (i.e., storage, like batteries or cars). Once a `SuperPeer` has transitioned to being a generator, it has a fixed `AvailableCapacity` (measured in kWh) that it can give back to the grid. After depleting its `AvailableCapacity` it goes into `sleep_mode`, where it is neither consuming nor generating. In `sleep_mode` it advertises that it wants to consume at its `ChargingRate` but is intentionally starved until its `Tracker` has found spare capacity, not reserved for *stochastic consumption* but regular peers.

# Generators
a `Generator` comes in one of three (3) types:
- stochastic
- fixed
- continuous

**Stochastic Generators** generate *randomly* up to a `MaxCapacity`, as determined by external factors (e.g., weather).

**Fixed Generators** generate at 100% of `MaxCapacity` when online.

**Continous Generators** may generate from 0% to 100% of their `MaxCapacity`, as determined by their `Tracker`.

All generators know how much `DemandResponsiveConsumption` the `Consumer`s in their tree have. A tree has a `MaxDemandResponse`. Issuing a `shed()` signal to `Consumer`s is a last resort. It is issued **only** after a `Tracker` cannot balance its region by asking `Storage` to `StopStoring()`/`Transition()` to `Generator`-mode, or by bringing new `Fixed Generators` online.

# Consumers
a `Consumer` may have a mix of consumption proportions:
- It may have a % of its `MaxConsumption` up to which its consumption is *stochastic*.
- It may have a % of its `MaxConsumption` that is `defer()`rable up to a fixed %.
- `MaxConsumption` = `StochasticConsumption` + `DeferrableConsumption`. `Consumer`s may have a % of their `DeferrableConsumption` that is *demand responsive*, meaning a `Generator`s can issue an RPC to have the `Consumer` `shed()` a fixed amount of consumption. The consumer `ACK`s that it is shedding the load (the `DemandResponsiveConsumption`).

# Storage 
Storage (Super-Peers), must respond to `StartStoring()` and `StopStoring()` RPCs from the generator in their distribution tree. Storage DERs switch from `Consumer`s to `Generator`s upon receiving `transition()` RPCs.

# Trackers
Trackers compute *ephemeral distribution trees* for temporary groups of `Generator`s and `Consumer`s within its region. Trackers match a `Consumer` with `Generator` such that the maximum amount of available generation is being utilized and the number of *starving* consumers is minimized.

# Evaluation
Evaluation will focus on metrics such as:
- Average âˆ†<sub>generator_load</sub> between all `generator`s their their `tracker`s. This metric is important because it helps us understand how much unmanaged load existed on the grid at a given moment in time.
- How does CPU load change as ratios between `generator`s and `consumer`s changes. (The G:C ratio.)
